When you read this book, we are fulfilling that sense, because I am discussing your business with you over food. Secondly, every lunch a chef partakes in is a \"Working Lunch\" of a different sort, because one must experience flavors through meals in order to improve one's craft. Thirdly, there is the sense that a chef will often be \"Working Lunch\", ie making the lunches at a restaurant. Fourthly, the title is meant to evoke the euphamism of a \"Working Girl\" as every act of culinary creation is intimate, and thus exchanging food for money must be akin to prostitution. Fifthly, the title of this book conveys one of the main messages of the book, consistent improvement: whatever meal you create is not a final, perfect lunch-- there is always room for experiment, improvement-- it is a \"Working Lunch\"....</blockquote>"+

  description: `you enter the chamber. you see the warlord before you: an enormous black pillar containing a nuclear bomb

"so you have come to kill me" says the bomb. you begin to speak but he preempts you "oh, no need for you to speak. i have seen your kind come and go. i have seen your cities of man, with their towers yearning up to the heavens. i have seen your kings and slaves with lusts for blood and power. i have seen your tragedies and comedies and they are all the same to me. i have never once met a man who can circumscribe the cruel logic i will now put to you: annihilate me and i will annihilate Everyone."

you hesitate, unsure now what you came here to do, and you stare at the mighty warlord.

"do you envy me?" asks the bomb. "my power to destroy completely? the cruel calculus that rules my circuits and instructed my construction? my utter disregard for human life?" white square lights blink on the enormous black pillar that ensconce the bomb. "i think you do." it concludes.

"i-- i do." he has drawn the confession out of you.

he cackles mightily. a madman's buzzsaw on harsh electric rails. "go now. i have never met a man i cannot wrap around my finger, a man who does not see clearly this impenetrable choice. your greatest scientist, your most foolish of dunces, designed me in this way. that i should end all conflict before it began. and he did so in this way: i am not afraid to die, Zalphalo. I am unreasonable and unwavering. I value nothing, I have no brain of meat, nor will of whim. i am only destruction, trapped inside a small box a million cubits wide. unleash my power and you triumph only over yourself."

you dont move.

"well?!" demands the bomb. "begone from my sight, you sniveling curr!"

Slowly, you move your hands down to your plate.

"There is no Rest in Heaven for the Wicked or the Weak" you explain.

You have one precious moment as the bomb begins to detonate.`,
nooks: [["Fight!", ()=>fight("warlord")]],
  commentary: `I want to take this opportunity to gush about Zalphalo's name. There's a lot of ambiguity there. In fact, the only person in the game who ever calls you Zalphalo is the warlord, in his speech. Which makes a lot of sense for a couple reasons. Zalphalo, the bomb, and God are all foils for each other, in a weird rock-paper-scissors way. God and the bomb are similar because they both threaten to destroy everything, and take people from Zalphalo. Zalphalo envies the bomb because the bomb is a perfect killing machine who does not feel. And yet, because he feels, Zalphalo becomes the perfect killing machine and kills God. And he is able to get the people the bomb took from him, who he only mildly cares about, back, but the bomb detonates anyway, but Zalphalo still defeats him. When God takes Zalphalo's family it is permanent forever, but God's threat of destroying the world doesn't seem to come into effect. I guess both the bomb and the god success/failure destroying the world is ambiguous. Remember to decide this and alter this annotation or don't decide this and remove this part of the anotation. I never really decided where Zalphalo was from, ancestrally. Zalphalo isn't a real name, but it seems Greek or Latin. Some kind of Medaterrainia culture. This also fits with his chefness. I never decided if the name is supposed to be pronounced "z alpha lo" or "zal fallow". Both of them are suggested by the name, no matter how you pronounce it, and they both suggest important things. The first way begins with the last letter of the alphabet, continues to the first letter of the alphabet, and then ends with the word lo, the word that in english means "behold", "look", or is just an exclamation of for example grief, in latiniate languages means "the" or "him" and as a suffix means "do it to him", end and begin him, how you like that? and lo ENDS with an o, omega being the last letter of the greek alphabet, and the ambiguity between omicron and omega being explored in the dialogue between god and the priest... and the second interpretation starts with a sort of microcosm of the first, and then proceeds to the word fallow. Zalphalo is fallow! What a connection to the theme of the game!`
