HOW TO PLAY:
Simply open index.html in your preferred html viewer of choice. You must have javascript enabled.


MOTIVATION:
I've attended one or two beginning programming classes in my time. In these classes, after you teach everyone how to make windows and buttons and manipulate variables in a basic manner, the coolest kid in class is always going to make a basic, stupid, button-clicking-based game. A pure expression, hewn with simple tools, of the joy of creativity. Zalphalo was conceived in honor of this.

INFORMATION ABOUT FILES:
gribsaba.js is the simple engine I cobbled together to facilitate this button-and-text adventure. The stuff in world/ is the code for the adventure itself. The stuff in assets/ is pictures and such.
