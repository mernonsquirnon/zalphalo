I've attended one or two beginning programming classes in my time. In these classes, after you teach everyone how to make windows and buttons and manipulate variables in a basic manner, the coolest kid in class is always going to make a basic, stupid, button-clicking-based game. A pure expression, hewn with simple tools, of the joy of creativity. Zalphalo was conceived in honor of this.

open index.html in the web browser of your choice to begin the game.

gribsaba.js is the simple engine I cobbled together to facilitate this button-and-text adventure. zalphalo.js is the code for the adventure itself.
