MOTIVATION:
I've attended one or two beginning programming classes in my time. In these classes, after you teach everyone how to make windows and buttons and manipulate variables in a basic manner, the coolest kid in class is always going to make a basic, stupid, button-clicking-based game. A pure expression, hewn with simple tools, of the joy of creativity. Zalphalo was conceived in honor of this, and everyone who has ever died.
